# SOS-TestProject

A very basic Android App. We can add functionality to this app if anyone asks for it.

I can also post useful bits of code for certain stages of our app.

Open IDE, choose import > android project from existing code >

This was built in Eclipse so let me know if anyone runs into any issues.

Sorry so last minute...

Notice the- 

src folder: this is where ALL the Java files are.
res > layout: are the layout xml files
res > drawables: are images and custom drawable xml files
AndroidManifest xml file is sort of the outline of the app. The guidelines for it.
